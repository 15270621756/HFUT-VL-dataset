HFUT VCC Vehicle Logo Dataset</br>

Dataset Description:</br>
--------------------------
The HFUT-CarLogo dataset contains 32000 car logo images, which came from on-road real time surveillance systems. Two different parts are included, HFUT-VL1 and HFUT-VL2.</br>

For HFUT-VL1, all car logo images are obtained through accurate location of the logo, which are used for evaluation of classification algorithms. In HFUT-VL1, 80 categories of logo images are included with size of 64*64, and each category has 200 images.</br>

For HFUT-VL2, all car logo images are obtained through a coarse location scheme, with the accurate location of car logos annotated by XML, which can be used both for evaluation of car logo classification and location algorithms. In HFUT-VL2, 80 categories of logo images are included with size of 64*96, and each category has 200 images.</br>
