# HFUT-VL-dataset
HFUT VCC Vehicle Logo Dataset</br>

Dataset Description:</br>
--------------------------
The HFUT-CarLogo dataset contains 32000 vehicle images and includes two parts. One is the HFUT-VL1 and the other is HFUT-VL2.</br>

The HFUT-VL1 dataset is the carlogo accurate location. All carlogo image in the dataset are divided into 80 categories according to different brands and each categorie has 200 images with the size of 64*64.</br>

The HFUT-VL2 dataset is the carlogo rough location. This dataset also has 80 categories and each categorie has 200 images with the size of 64*96. Due to the carlogo with rough location, the location of each carlogo is pre-annotated. The dataset can also be used for evaluating the performance of carlogo detection. The annotation is save by XML and could be opened by python.</br>
